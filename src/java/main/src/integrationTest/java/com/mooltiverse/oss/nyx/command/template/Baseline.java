/**
 * This annotation can be used to define a well known Git baseline to be realized in a Git repository when
 * a test runs. Available baselines are defined as {@link Scenario}s, which indeed is the value that must be
 * declared by this annotation. Baselines are realized in a new temporary directory each time.
 * <br>
 * The baseline being realized may be directly represented by a parameter that is injected into a test method
 * (when the injected parameter is of type {@link Script}, {@link Workbench}) or used by other objects
 * (i.e. of type {@link Command} or {@link CommandProxy}), which need a local Git repository to be realized
 * before they are created.
 * <br>
 * This annotation can be applied directly on test method parameters, test methods or their declaring classes
 * and where it is defined also defines its scope. When applied on a method parameter it's scope is not shared
 * so, for example, if you define two {@link Script} parameters and the annotation is on parameters, their
 * scenario is not shared and you must define the annotation on each parameter. If it's defined on the test method
 * all parameters that need a baseline will use the same baseline unless they override at the parameter level.
 * If you apply the annotation at the class level then it will be shared among all methods within the class
 * and their parameters, unless overridden at the method or parameter scope.
 * <br>
 * In order for elements using this annotation to be resolved you need to use the
 * {@link CommandInvocationContextProvider} extension (<code>@ExtendWith(CommandInvocationContextProvider.class)</code>)
 * on the test method or its declaring class.
 * 
 * @see CommandProxy
 * @see CommandInvocationContextProvider
 * @see Script
 * @see Workbench
