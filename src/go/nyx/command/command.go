		This method uses the quickest method to verify whether the state is up to date or not. This method must not rely on
		dependencies and it must always evaluate its own status independently.

		As a general rule this method checks if its inputs (i.e. from the configuration) have changed since the last run.

		- DataAccessError in case the configuration can't be loaded for some reason.
		- IllegalPropertyError in case the configuration has some illegal options.
		- GitError in case of unexpected issues when accessing the Git repository.
