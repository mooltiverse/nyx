/*
Publishes a set of assets for a release. Even when the service supports the RELEASE_ASSETS
feature not all types of assets may be supported. Please check the implementation class for any restrictions
on the supported assets.

Returns the given release with also the links to the uploaded assets. The returned object represents the same
release provided as parameter but may be a different instance. Only the assets that were actually published
are returned while those not supported by the implementing service are not within the list of assets referred
by the returned object

Arguments are as follows:

  - owner the name of the repository owner to create the assets for. It may be nil, in which case,
    the repository owner must be passed as a service option (see services implementing this interface for more
    details on the options they accept). If not nil this value overrides the option passed to the service.
  - repository the name of the repository to create the assets for. It may be nil, in which case,
    the repository name must be passed as a service option (see services implementing this interface for more
    details on the options they accept). If not nil this value overrides the option passed to the service.
  - release the release to publish the assets for. It must be an object created by the same service
    implementation
  - assets the set of assets to publish. Assets may be interpreted differently depending on their
    path and type. Please check the implementation class for restrictions on the supported assets

Errors can be:

- SecurityError if authentication or authorization fails or there is no currently authenticated user
- TransportError if communication to the remote endpoint fails
- UnsupportedOperationError if the underlying implementation does not support the RELEASES feature.
