name: "Setup Gradle"
description: |-
  Run the common tasks to setup a Gradle environment from scratch or restoring
  the environment from a previous job:
  - grants execute permissions to the gradlew script
  - set up the JDK
  - set up a Gradle cache for distributed up-to-date checks across jobs so
    Gradle tasks can use the cache by just using the --build-cache option
  Please note that this Action doesn't run any actual command or task other
  than those used to set up the environment. Build commands are to be executed
  after this Action completes.
  
  Also note that the underlying cache implementation is different when the
  workflow runs in the 'main' branch or not.
  When in the 'main' branch it uses the 'burrunan/gradle-cache-action@', which
  is much more efficient but since that action doesn't work on any other branch
  than 'main' we need to fall back to a custom cache handling when in other
  branches.
  The custom cache works well in a 'linear' scenario, when one job follows the
  other, but has issues in merging caches from multiple jobs into one (i.e.
  for 'fan-in' or 'waypoint' jobs) so in that case you basically just need
  to start from the most significant cache, and Gradle will consider all the
  tasks executed by other jobs not up to date.
  Due to the above, the 'cache-name-suffix' and 'cache-name-restore-suffix'
  inputs are only used for non-'main' branches, while for the 'main' branch
  the centralized cache will only use the 'cache-name-prefix' for all caches.
inputs:
  directory:
    description: |-
      The directory, relative to the repository root and without the trailing
      slash, where the contents for this feature are stored.
      As long as you are using the common project layour you don't need to
      change this directory.
      This directory is used to probe this feature. See the 'probed' output for
      more.
      Default: .
    required: false
    default: '.'
  verbosity:
    description: |-
      Sets the verbosity level to adjust the output logs verbosity.
      Allowed values are: 'error', 'warning', 'quiet', 'info', 'debug'.
      Default: quiet
    required: false
    default: 'quiet'
  enable-cache:
    description: |-
      Whether to enable the cache.
      Default: true
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  cache-name-prefix:
    description: |-
      The prefix of the name to use for the cache that will be read and/or
      written by this Action.
      If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
      scratch without errors.
      Default: gradle-\$\{\{ github.run_id \}\}
    required: false
    default: 'gradle-${{ github.run_id }}'
  cache-name-suffix:
    description: |-
      The suffix of the name to use for the cache that will be written by this
      Action.
      If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
      scratch without errors.
      In case you want multiple jobs share the same artifacts you can either
      set this value to a generic identifier (which might as well be the
      name of the job that bootstrapped the cache), using the same in all jobs,
      or even leave it empty. What's important for sharing the same artifacts
      is that all jobs use the same value for this attribute, so they use the
      same cache instance.
      Remember, though, that regardless of which job writes the cache, the same
      entry (file) can only be written once in the cache so this means that
      jobs may add new entries but not overwrite existing ones with new versions.
      In the other case, when you need jobs to write new versions of files, you
      need chaining caches, which means one job creates the first cache, then
      others need to read from the previous cache version and create a new cache
      with updated contents.
      When chaining caches, this value should be (or at least include) the ID
      of the Job that writes the cache, while the 'cache-name-restore-suffix'
      has the value of the 'cache-name-suffix' of the job to read the previous
      cache from.
      This allows to chain caches in a way that each job writes its own cache,
      while starting from a previous cache written by some other job.
      Default: \$\{\{ github.job \}\}
    required: false
    default: '${{ github.job }}'
  cache-name-restore-suffix:
    description: |-
      The suffix of the name to use for the cache that will be read by this
      Action.
      If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
      scratch without errors.
      In case you want multiple jobs share the same artifacts just use the
      same value here of the 'cache-name-suffix' attribute used in all jobs
      sharing the cache.
      In the other case, when you need jobs to write new versions of files,
      you need chaining caches, which means one job creates the first cache,
      then others need to read from the previous cache version and create a
      new cache with updated contents. In this case this value must be the
      'cache-name-suffix' of the job to read the previous version of the
      cache from. This way you can start from the previous job's cache and
      create a new version.
      By default this value is the same as 'cache-name-suffix' so as long as
      you don't set this value this cache will be read-only.
      Default: \$\{\{ github.job \}\}
    required: false
    default: '${{ github.job }}'
  cache-contents:
    description: |-
      The entries to include in the cache.
      You can use a multi-line value here to specify multiple entries.
