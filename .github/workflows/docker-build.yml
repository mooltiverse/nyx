          The whitespace separated list of Gradle arguments to pass on the

          For example you may use '--quiet', '--warn', '--info', '--debug' to
          set the verbosity level.
          For more see: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html.
          The -PbuildCacheTo='type=gha,mode=max' -PbuildCacheFrom='type=gha'
          can be used to enable the Docker GitHub Actions cache used when
          building the Docker images using BuildKit. These options are parsed
          by our Gradle scripts building the Docker images and allow the
          scripts to invoke the 'docker buildx build' command with the
          '--cache-to type=gha[,parameters...]' and
          '--cache-from type=gha[,parameters...]' arguments to improve the
          performances and reuse layers.

          Moreover, this can be used to override the default Gradle action's
          cache prefix to make all jobs within the same stream (i.e. a feature)
          share the same prefix and not overlap with other streams. However,
          when setting this prefix to some specific feature you won't be
          able to merge the caches and in case you 'chain' them you can only
          use one upstream cache for each downstream job.
