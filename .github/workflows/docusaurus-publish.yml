          For more see: https://github.com/actions/setup-java.
          Please note that the tools come preinstalled in many hosted GitHub

      nyx-cache-name-restore-suffix:
        description: |-
          The suffix of the name to use for the cache that will be read by this
          workflow. This is useful to 'chain' caches, so here you can pass the
          suffix from a previous cache to make this workflow start from that
          one cache.
          If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
          scratch without errors.
          Default: none
        type: string
        required: false
        default: ""
      gradle-cache-name-prefix:
        description: |-
          The prefix to use for the cache that will be read by this workflow.
          This is useful to 'chain' caches, so here you can pass the suffix
          from a previous cache to make this workflow start from that one cache.
          Moreover, this can be used to override the default Gradle action's
          cache prefix to make all jobs within the same stream (i.e. a feature)
          share the same prefix and not overlap with other streams. However,
          when setting this prefix to some specific feature you won't be
          able to merge the caches and in case you 'chain' them you can only
          use one upstream cache for each downstream job.
          If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
          scratch without errors.
          Default: gradle-\$\{\{ github.job \}\}-docusaurus (isolate the cache for
          the 'docusaurus' feature).
        type: string
        required: false
        default: "gradle-${{ github.run_id }}-docusaurus"
      gradle-cache-name-restore-suffix:

          suffix from a previous cache to make this workflow start from that
          one cache.
          If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
          scratch without errors.
          Default: \$\{\{ github.job \}\}
        type: string
        required: false
        default: "${{ github.job }}"

      path:
        description: |-
          The path, relative to the local repository, where the site artifacts
          to publish are.
          Note this must be the path of the built site, not the site source.
          Default: docs
        type: string
        required: false
        default: "docs"
      enable-github-pages:
        description: |-
          Whether to deploy the site to GitHub pages or not.
          GitHub pages must be enabled for the repository or the whole
          organization in advance, through GitHub settings.
          Sites are supposed to be published to GitHub pages only from the
          'main' (or 'master') branch, but you can override this using
          this input value.
          Consider setting this value conditionally true when invoking
          this workflow based on the current branch, like:
              enable-github-pages: \$\{\{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' \}\}
          Default: false
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: false
      enable-s3-bucket:
        description: |-
          Whether to deploy the site to an S3 bucket or not.
          When this is enabled the 'aws-access-key-id' input and
          the 'aws-secret-access-key' secret must also be set to pass
          the credentials needed to access the S3 bucket.
          Sites are supposed to be published to S3 buckets only from the
          'main' (or 'master') branch, but you can override this using
          this input value.
          Consider setting this value conditionally true when invoking
          this workflow based on the current branch, like:
              enable-s3-bucket: \$\{\{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' \}\}
          Default: false
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: false
      aws-region:
        description: |-
          The AWS region to use for remote API.

      gradle-secret-arguments:
        description: |-
          The whitespace separated list of Gradle arguments to pass on the
          Gradle command line. This is for passing sensitive values.
          See also 'gradle-arguments' for passing non sensitive values.
          For example you may use '--quiet', '--warn', '--info', '--debug' to
          set the verbosity level.
