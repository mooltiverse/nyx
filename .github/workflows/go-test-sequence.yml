# Run Go tests in a job sequence.
#
# This workflow runs unit, integration and functional tests in separate
# jobs and is well suited for medium and large test suites.
# Execution is performed in the unit > integration > functional test
# sequence so each job only runs if the previous is successful.
# For smaler suites see the 'go-test-compact.yml' workflow.

          one cache.
          If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from

          This is useful to 'chain' caches, so here you can pass the suffix
          from a previous cache to make this workflow start from that one cache.
          Moreover, this can be used to override the default Gradle action's
          cache prefix to make all jobs within the same stream (i.e. a feature)
          share the same prefix and not overlap with other streams. However,
          when setting this prefix to some specific feature you won't be
          able to merge the caches and in case you 'chain' them you can only
          use one upstream cache for each downstream job.
          If the cache to read does not exists a new one will be created from
          scratch without errors.
          Default: gradle-\$\{\{ github.job \}\}-go (isolate the cache for
          the 'go' feature).
