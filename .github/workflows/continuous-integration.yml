# The Nyx CI pipeline running on GitHub Actions
#
# CACHES
#
# We use GitHub Actions caches in two different modes:
# - by mean of actions/cache: we use different caches in order to narrow their size. The major issue
#   with this kind of cache is that each job can create a new one and store its contents but it cannot
#   update and store new contents for an existing cache. This is a limitation and since we need to
#   increment the contents of a cache across several jobs, we need to 'chain' caches so that we can
#   pull an existing one, change its contents, and then store it under a different name. For this reason
#   we disambiguate caches with a trailing identifier (represented by the job that stored the cache)
#   so that each cache 'instance' represents a specific 'stage' within the pipeline for that cache.
# - by mean of burrunan/gradle-cache-action: this cache also uses actions/cache under the hood but is
#   specifically optimized for Gradle as it's layered and it hides the complexity of 'chaining' caches
#   so we define it the same way for each job. This cache leverages Gradle caching to run Gradle tasks
#   incrementally.
#   This cache is remote (to GitHub Actions) so jobs running on different workers share it.
#   See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html for more on the Gradle Build Cache.
# 
# Provided the above about 'chaining' caches for specific 'stages', we have several caches, each one
# containing a specific set of files (the cache scope).
# The first job that creates a certain cache only defines the cache 'key' and no 'restore-keys'
# (as there is still no cache to restore) while subsequent ones define a new 'key' (adding the job ID
# as a trailer in the cache ID) but also uses the 'key' generated for that cache from the job that
# comes before in the 'chain'.
#
# We always create caches with identifiers containing the ${{ github.run_id }} in order to avoid
# overlappings across multiple pipeline runs.
#
# The caches we use in the pipeline are:
# - the pipeline cache (using key pipeline-${{ github.run_id }}-[JOB_ID]) that brings
#   some pipeline overall artifacts like the Nyx state
# - the Java cache (using key java-${{ github.run_id }}--[JOB_ID]) that brings
#   Java specific artifacts from the assemble tasks up to tests
# - the Go cache (using key go-${{ github.run_id }}--[JOB_ID]) that brings
#   Go specific artifacts from the assemble tasks up to tests
# - the Docker cache (using key docker-${{ github.run_id }}--[JOB_ID]) that brings
#   Docker specific artifacts from the assemble tasks up to tests. Since the Docker image needs the
#   Go binaries this cache is forked from the Go cache after Go build/assemble tasks have completed
# - the Build cache (using key build-${{ github.run_id }}) that brings all Build
#   artifacts (but no tests) from the language specific build tasks
#
# MORE ON CACHES
# Remember that:
# - the 'path' items within 'actions/cache' actions must be the same when storing and retrieving the cache
#   otherwise it won't work
# - the above rules mean that a certain set of files/directories must always follow the same cache as
# they can't be mixed up. On the other hand, each job may use/store multiple caches
