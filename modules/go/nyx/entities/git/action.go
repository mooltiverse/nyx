This object is a Git action value holder independent from the underlying Git implementation.

This structure is JSON and YAML aware so all objects are properly managed for marshalling and unmarshalling. This comes with a downside
as all internal fields must be exported (have the first capital letter in their names) or they can't be marshalled.
