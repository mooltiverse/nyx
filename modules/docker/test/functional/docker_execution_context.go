This package provides functional tests.

In order to make these tests work both from regular hosts and from inside other containers
(i.e. Development Containers) we need to mount the test repository data with Docker volumes,
otherwise, if we mount a folder into the test container, the folder that Docker tries to
mount is always from the host, even when running inside a development container, and in that
case tests fail.
