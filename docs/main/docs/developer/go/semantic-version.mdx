# Semantic Version

The [`version`](https://godocs.io/github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version) package provides you with a fully featured implementation of the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) specification without any external dependency. Full support for parsing, ordering, bumping and manipulating versions and their identifiers is provided.

This library is used at the Nyx core but yet is completely independent from its logic so is perfectly suitable for use in ano other context.

## Get the library

To install the module locally run:

```sh
go get github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version
```

To import it in your source code:

```go
import "github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version"
```

## API docs

Thanks to [Go docs](https://godocs.io/) you can browse the API docs at [this URL](https://godocs.io/github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version).

## Using the library

Using the library is simple. You just need to create a [`SemanticVersion`](https://godocs.io/github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version#SemanticVersion) and use it as in the following example.

**Remember the `SemanticVersion` is immutable** so every time you invoke a method that changes the number you actually get a new object representing the new state.

```go
package main

import version "github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/src/go/version"

func main() {
  // parse any string as a semantic version, in this case we use the default initial version "0.1.0"
  v1, err := version.ValueOfSemanticVersion(version.SEMANTIC_VERSION_DEFAULT_INITIAL_VERSION)
  // bump the MINOR number > "0.2.0"
  v2, err := v1.BumpMinor()
  // bump the MAJOR number > "1.0.0"
  v3, err := v2.BumpMajor()
  // bump the new pre-release identifier named 'alpha' > "1.0.0-alpha.1"
  v4, err := v3.BumpPrerelease("alpha")
  // bump the 'alpha' pre-release identifier again > "1.0.0-alpha.2"
  v5, err := v4.BumpPrerelease("alpha")
  // add the 'build' identifier and give it the '123' value > "1.0.0-alpha.2+build.123"
  v6, err := v5.SetBuild("build", "123")
  // and so on...
}
```

The `SemanticVersion` also provides additional useful methods to handle arbitrary identifiers so that it's even more expressive. For example:

```go
v1, err := version.ValueOfSemanticVersion("2.0.3")
v2, err := v1.SetBuildAttributeWith("timestamp", "20200101T1500")    // v2 is now "2.0.3+timestamp.20200101T1500"
// but in another run you want to overwrite the attribute with the same name, so...
v3, err := v2.SetBuildAttributeWith("timestamp", "20991201T2359")    // v3 is now "2.0.3+timestamp.20991201T2359"
// or add a branch name and a tag value in the pre-release part, one as a simple attribute and the other as a named pair
v4, err := v3.SetPrereleaseAttributeWith("develop").setPrereleaseAttribute("tag", 3)
// v4 is now "2.0.3-develop.tag.3+timestamp.20991201T2359"
```
