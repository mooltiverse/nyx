# Go

In this section you can find instructions to use the available Go libraries to be used in your own projects.

All Go libraries have public API docs hosted [here](https://godocs.io/?q=nyx) (thanks [Go docs](https://godocs.io/)).

All artifacts are available in the [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/mooltiverse/packages) repositories, where you can find binaries for all platforms and architectures.

The available libraries are:

* **[Nyx Main](nyx-main.mdx)**: the entire Nyx implementation available as a library for you to embed and use
* **[Semantic Version](semantic-version.mdx)**: a flexible implementation of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification with full support for parsing, ordering, bumping and manipulating versions and their identifiers
