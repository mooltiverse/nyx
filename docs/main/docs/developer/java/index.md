# Java

In this section you can find instructions to use the available Java libraries to be used in your own projects.

All java libraries have public API docs hosted [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx/java) (thanks [javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/)).

All artifacts are available at the [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx) and the [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/mooltiverse/packages) repositories.

The available libraries are:

* **[Nyx Main](nyx-main.mdx)**: the entire Nyx implementation available as a library for you to embed and use
* **[Semantic Version](semantic-version.mdx)**: a flexible implementation of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification with full support for parsing, ordering, bumping and manipulating versions and their identifiers
