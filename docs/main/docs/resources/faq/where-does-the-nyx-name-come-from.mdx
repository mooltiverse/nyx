# Where does the Nyx name come from?

Nyx is named after *3908 Nyx*, a notable [Mars crossing asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3908_Nyx), which in turn is named after the [the Greek goddess of the night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx). We liked the name as it's three letters like the number of a semantic version number.
