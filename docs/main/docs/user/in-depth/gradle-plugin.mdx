# Gradle Plugin

In this page you can find extra information about the Nyx Gradle Plugin internals that may be useful for [troubleshooting](../../resources/troubleshooting/index.md).

See the [Quick Start](../quick-start/gradle-plugin.mdx) or [Using the Gradle plugin](../introduction/usage.mdx#using-the-gradle-plugin) for regular usage instructions.

## Performance improvements

### Deferred task creation

According to [configuration avoidance](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/task_configuration_avoidance.html) the plugin *registers* the tasks to the gradle project instead of *creating* them. This means that Gradle will only instantiate them when needed to improve the overall performances and avoid unnecessary tasks to run when not needed.

For more see the [`register`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html#register-java.lang.String-java.lang.Class-) and [`create`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html#create-java.lang.String-java.lang.Class-) methods on the [`TaskContainer`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html) class.

### Task dependencies

Nyx tasks have *chained* [dependencies](../introduction/usage.mdx#core-tasks) among each others. However, these dependencies are implemented within the Nyx core, not at the Gradle task level. This makes no difference from the user's point of view but it may be helpful to know if you're playing with Gradle task dependencies.
