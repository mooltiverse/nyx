# Configuration Reference

This section give you a detailed reference on Nyx configuration and command line options.

Before diving into this reference make sure you have read the [quick start](../quick-start/index.md) and the [introduction guide](../introduction/index.md).

When in doubt you can also check out the available [examples](../../resources/examples/index.md).

Contents are organized by following the same hierarchy used in configuration options. Get started with the [global options](global-options.mdx).
