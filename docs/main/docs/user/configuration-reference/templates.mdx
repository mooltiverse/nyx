# Templates

Templates can be used in several places to make configuration dynamic or parametrize text outputs, be them strings, messages or even whole text files.

Nyx uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates passing the engine the [internal state](../state-reference/index.md) for the template scope (the template input value) so it's easy to figure out which values are available. Moreover a few [functions](#functions) (lambdas) are available for common needs.

:::info
Handlebars is also compatible with [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templates so you can reuse them.
:::

:::info
Tip: when writing templates you may find useful to [serialize the state to a file](global-options.mdx#state-file) for reference or troubleshooting.
:::

## Reference

### Render a static output

At times you just need to output a simple hardcoded string instead of rendering even the simplest template. Don't even bother with `{{ }}` delimiters in this case and simply enter the value.

This means that wherever templates are allowed, you can still use static text, with no templates.

Let's assume you want to set the `Hello World` value for a configuration `option`, then your template is just the plain `Hello World`:

```text
option = "Hello World"
```

### Render a simple string

Often times you just need to use a simple value from the [Nyx state](../state-reference/index.md) to be the result of the template.

This is fairly simple as you just need to wrap the name of the [state](../state-reference/index.md) attribute with double curly braces, like `{{attribute}}`. This is the simplest form of a [Handlebars expression](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#simple-expressions) (and yes, the double curly brances are the *handlebars*, or *mustaches*).

:::info
Please note that only **simple** attributes from the [state](../state-reference/index.md) can be rendered this way, while complex objects like [changelog](../state-reference/global-attributes.mdx#changelog), [configuration](../state-reference/global-attributes.mdx#configuration) and [releaseScope](../state-reference/global-attributes.mdx#release-scope) cannot be rendered as a whole. Instead, their children can be rendered as simple attributes.
:::

So if we want to set our configuration `option` to the current value of the `version` attribute from the [state](../state-reference/index.md) our definition will look like:

```text
option = "{{version}}"
```

When the value you need to render is nested into another (i.e. `section/attribute` or `section.attribute`, depending on the notation), the template looks like:

```text
option = "{{#section}}{{attribute}}{{/section}}"
```

As you can see this is a little cumbersome for a simple value but you will soon understand how powerful it can be. What is important to note here is that the `{{attribute}}` expression is now enclosed between a `{{#section}}` opening tag and a `{{/section}}` closing tag (denoted by the `#` and `/` characters).

Alternatively you can simply use the dotted notation, like:

```text
option = "{{section.attribute}}"
```

### Type conversions

All templates return text values but ofter times the template output needs to be converted to other types. This may happen for configuration options, for example, when a dynamically computed value needs a boolean or a number. You can always tell if some conversion is to be performed by the *type* of the option.

This table gives you the overall rules used to convert text values to types other than strings:

| Expected type    | Translation criteria                                                                                          |
| -----------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| boolean          | If the expression returns an empty or blank string translates to `false`, otherwise returns the boolean evaluation of the string value |
| number           | Translates to the number representation of the string when it contains a valid number, `0` in all other cases, including when the string does not contain a valid number. Different numeric types (i.e. integers and floats) require specific constraints to be met in order for the conversion to succeed, as per the standard number representation rules |

## Functions

Wherever templates are allowed you can also use functions to produce outputs or transform an input value. These functions are provided by lambdas and the syntax is like the one we've seen for nested values, like in this example:

```text
option = "{{#upper}}{{ attribute }}{{/upper}}"
```

Here `upper` is a function accepting one parameter (`attribute`) and returning the same output, with upper case. Below you can find the list of available lambdas.

:::info
The underlying [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine also provides an powerful set of built-in functions to handle conditionals, loops, lookups and log messages. Those functions (a.k.a. *helpers*) can be freely used in templates but they are not officially supported by Nyx. For more on those helpers see [Built-in Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html).
:::

Functions can be nested for combined output. This example is valid and shows how to take the first 20 characters from the given `{{ attribute }}` and transform it to upper case:

```text
option = "{{#upper}}{{#cutRight length="20"}}{{ attribute }}{{/cutRight}}{{/upper}}"
```

### `replace`

Replaces all occurrences of a given character sequence with another character sequence in the input string. The `from` option defines the sequence to be replaced while the `to` option defines the sequence to use for replacement.

Example:

```text
output = "{{#replace from="X" to="Y"}}{{input}}{{/replace}}"
```

Example inputs and corresponding outputs:

| Input                                      | Options             | Output             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `01234567890`                              | `from="0"`          | `123456789`        |
| `01234567890`                              | `from="0" to=""`    | `123456789`        |
| `01234567890`                              | `from="0" to="X"`   | `X123456789X`      |
| `01234567890`                              | `from="45" to="_"`  | `0123_67890`       |

### `capture`

Matches a regular expression against the input value and extracts a portion of it. The portion to be extracted must be a capturing group (identified by its index or *named*) defined in the regular expression. Remember that when using indexes, `0` is the group that returns the whole string.

The `expression` option defines the regular expression, while the `group` option can be either a positive integer (in which case the group will be extracted by its index) or a string (to extract the capturing group by its name).

:::info
Use of *named capturing group* is recommended in place of using groups by their index as it's consistent between the Java (Gradle) and Go (command line) implementations. Retrieving groups by index may lead to different outcomes as the two underlying frameworks use a different numbering for groups.
:::

Example:

```text
output = "{{#capture expression="(?<type>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)(\((?<scope>[a-z ]+)\))?:( (?<title>.+))" group="type"}}{{input}}{{/capture}}"
```

Example inputs and corresponding outputs:

| Input                                      | Options                                                                                               | Output             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `mytype(myscope): mytitle`                 | `expression="(?<type>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)(\((?<scope>[a-z ]+)\))?:( (?<title>.+))" group="1"`               | `mytype`           |
| `mytype(myscope): mytitle`                 | `expression="(?<type>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)(\((?<scope>[a-z ]+)\))?:( (?<title>.+))" group="type"`            | `mytype`           |

:::info
Use tools like [regular expressions 101](https://regex101.com/) to write and test your regular expressions.
:::

### `cutLeft`

Returns only the last N characters of the input, where N is an arbitrary positive integer represented by the `length` option. If the input is shorter than N characters it's returned untouched. This is often useful to shorten SHAs. Example:

| `7b`                                       | `length=3` | `7b`       |

### `cutRight`

Returns only the first N characters of the input, where N is an arbitrary positive integer represented by the `length` option. If the input is shorter than N characters it's returned untouched. This is often useful to shorten SHAs. Example:

| `7b`                                       | `length=3` | `7b`        |

### `short5`

Returns only the first 5 characters of the input. If the input is shorter than 5 characters it's returned untouched. This is often useful to shorten SHAs. Example:

```text
output = "{{#short5}}{{input}}{{/short5}}"
```

Example inputs and corresponding outputs:

| Input                                      | Output     |

| `7b`                                       | `7b`       |

For arbitrary length strings see [`cutLeft`](#cutleft) and [`cutRight`](#cutright).

### `short6`

For arbitrary length strings see [`cutLeft`](#cutleft) and [`cutRight`](#cutright).

### `short7`

```text
output = "{{#short7}}{{input}}{{/short7}}"
```

For arbitrary length strings see [`cutLeft`](#cutleft) and [`cutRight`](#cutright).


### `timeFormat`

Returns a timestamp formatted according to the given format string.

The value for the timestamp is the current system time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT unless a value is provided.

The returned string is the timestamp as an integer value unless the `format` option is passed with a valid format string.

:::warning
Since the underlying frameworks have different behaviors, the output from this function may not be consistent between the command line version (written in Go) and the Gradle version (written in Java). The format string passd in the `format` option also depends on the implementation. Please see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) for the available patterns available in Java and [here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#example-Time.Format) and [here](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants) for those available in Go. Moreover, when invalid patterns are passed in the `format` option, the behavior is different between the two implementations: the Java implementation returns and empty string (and logs an error), while the Go implementation just returns the plain value passed in the `format` option. For consistent behavior functions see [`timestampISO8601`](#timestampiso8601) and [`timestampYYYYMMDDHHMMSS`](#timestampyyyymmddhhmmss).

### `timestampISO8601`

Provided a timestamp in the [unix format](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) returns it formatted as [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) UTC. If the input is not a Unix timestamp returns an empty string. Example:

```text
output = "{{#timestampISO8601}}{{timestamp}}{{/timestampISO8601}}"
```

Example inputs and corresponding outputs:

| Input                      | Output                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `1608210396`               | `2020-12-17T13:06:36`      |

For arbitrary timestamp formats see [`timeFormat`](#timeformat).

### `timestampYYYYMMDDHHMMSS`

Provided a timestamp in the [unix format](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) returns it formatted as `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` UTC. If the input is not a Unix timestamp returns an empty string. Example:

```text
output = "{{#timestampYYYYMMDDHHMMSS}}{{timestamp}}{{/timestampYYYYMMDDHHMMSS}}"
```

Example inputs and corresponding outputs:

| Input                      | Output                     |

| `1608210396 `              | `20201217130636`           |

For arbitrary timestamp formats see [`timeFormat`](#timeformat).

### `environmentUser`

Returns the current system user name. Example:

```text
user = "{{environmentUser}}"
```

or, if you prefer the open/close tags:

```text
user = "{{#environmentUser}}{{/environmentUser}}"
```

In case you pass a value to this function it is ignored.

### `environmentVariable`

Returns the value of the environment variable used as parameter, if any. Example:

```text
os = "{{#environmentVariable}}OS{{/environmentVariable}}"
```

returns the value of the `OS` environment variable, if present, or an empty string.

### `fileContent`

Returns content of the given file, if it exists, or an empty string. Example:

```text
filecontent = "{{#fileContent}}example.txt{{/fileContent}}"
```

returns returns the **entire** content of the `example.txt` file (if it exists).

The file name can be a relative or an absolute path. Please note that when a relative path is used, it's always resolved to the current working directory and other configured directories are ignored.

Be careful with the file content type, which must be text, and its size.

### `fileExists`

Returns the string representation of a boolean, depending on whether the the given file exists. Example:

```text
fileexists = "{{#fileExists}}example.txt{{/fileExists}}"
```

returns `true` if the `example.txt` file exists, `false` otherwise.

The file name can be a relative or an absolute path. Please note that when a relative path is used, it's always resolved to the current working directory and other configured directories are ignored.

## Example

Here is a more complex example where we combine several state attributes to produce a multi-line text content. This example is only useful to show the use of templates and is not meant to be used anywhere.

Consider this template:

```text
Version: {{version}} (bumping '{{bump}}' on {{configuration.initialVersion}} using lenient ({{configuration.releaseLenient}}))
Scheme: {{scheme}}
Timestamp: {{timestamp}}
OS: {{#environmentVariable}}OS{{/environmentVariable}}
User: {{environmentUser}}
Previous Version: {{releaseScope.previousVersion}} at {{#short5}}{{releaseScope.previousVersionCommit}}{{/short5}}

Commits:
{{#releaseScope.commits}}
  {{.}}
{{/releaseScope.commits}}
```

When rendered, it yields to an output like:

```text
Version: 9.8.6 (bumping 'theta' on 1.2.3 using lenient (true))
Scheme: SEMVER
Timestamp: 9223372036854775807
OS: Linux
Users: jdoe
Previous Version: 4.5.6 at 05cbf

```

As you can see there are state attributes like `version`, `bump`, `scheme` and `timestamp` used in the template and their usage should already be clear.

But since the resolved configuration is also available as a [nested state object](../state-reference/global-attributes.mdx#configuration), a couple of attributes are fetched from there, as you can see by `configuration.initialVersion` and `configuration.releaseLenient`.

Some values are retrieved from the current environment: the `OS` environment variable is fetched by the `{{#environmentVariable}}OS{{/environmentVariable}}` block (where the function parameter `OS` is the name of the variable to retrieve) and also the system user name is retrieved by `{{{environmentUser}}`.

Moreover, the [release scope](../state-reference/release-scope.mdx) is also used to get the `releaseScope.previousVersion` and `releaseScope.previousVersionCommit`. By pay attention here: the `previousVersionCommit` is not used as is but only the shortened SHA-1 is used, thanks to the [`short5`](#short5) function.

Finally, all the SHA-1 IDs of the release scope commits are printed, as you can see by the final block enclosed within `#releaseScope.commits` and `/releaseScope.commits`.
