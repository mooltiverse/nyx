# Services

Services are objects performing additional operations to be plugged in the overall workflow. They may support one or more [features](#service-features) and they are invoked by specific configurations. The points where a service can be invoked from depend on the features they provide so for each invocation point the list of required features is outlined. Example services are those used to publish releases on Git hosting service like [GitHub](#github) and [GitLab](#gitlab) or produce artifacts using templates.

The configuration of services is somewhat different from other options as each service is associated to a [*type*](#service-types) (or *class*) which represents the implementation. This is because services are not purely declarative entities but they rely on some underlying custom implementation. There may be multiple *instances* of services with the same *type* to let users define different configurations depending on the specific use of a certain service for different purposes.

Services are configured within the `services` section. The section is a map of objects where entry names are symbolic names chosen by the user and objects are service definitions. Furthermore, each service accepts a number of options, also defined in a nested map, with available map values documented for each service *type*. See the [examples](../../resources/examples/index.md) section for hints on how to configure services.

## Service definition

Within the `services` block you can define as many services as you want, each in its own separate block. The `name` identifies the service configuration so to define a brand new one make sure you give it a `name` that was not already in use. If you use a `name` that was already defined for a service (given the [evaluation order](../introduction/configuration-methods.mdx#evaluation-order)) then you are **overriding** an existing service. Depending on the [configuration method](../introduction/configuration-methods.mdx) you use the `name` property might be defined inside or outside the block that configures a single service.

Each service configuration has the following attributes:

| Name                                                                                       | Type    | Command Line Option                                                   | Environment Variable                                                    | Default                                              |

:::warning
When using multiple [configuration methods](../introduction/configuration-methods.mdx) or customizing [presets](../configuration-presets/index.md), these values must be inherited or overridden as a whole. Overriding single values and inheriting others is not supported for this type of configuration option so when they are re-declared at one configuration level, all inherited values from those configuration methods with lower precedence are suppressed.

A map where each entry defines a configuration option for the service. Available options depend on the service [type](#type).

The values specified here can be [templates](templates.mdx) to be evaluated at runtime to make the configuration dynamic.

The default is the empty map.

:::info
When configuring this map using command line options or environment variables you need to pass flattened values as documented [here](../introduction/configuration-methods.mdx#collections-of-objects). In this case you can pass each option as a command line option like `--services-<NAME>-options-<OPTION_NAME>=<VALUE>` or as an environment variable like `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_<OPTION_NAME>=<VALUE>`.

The type (class) of the service being configured. Available types are:

* [`GITHUB`](#github)
* [`GITLAB`](#gitlab)

This option is **mandatory**.

## Service types

### GitHub

The service of `GITHUB` [type](#type) giving you access to [GitHub](https://github.com/) extra features. This service type supports the `RELEASES` and `RELEASE_ASSETS` [features](#service-features) to publish a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github) when a new release is produced, also with attached assets.

#### Release support

This service type supports all release publication features with no limitations. See below for release assets.

#### Release assets support

This service supports only local files for [release assets](release-assets.mdx) while links to external elements are not supported. This means that if you declare an asset whose [path](release-assets.mdx#path) is an URL it will be ignored and the asset will not appear along with the release. This is due to the way GitHub manages release assets.

:::info
One way to work around this limitation and add links to the release is to customize the [changelog template](changelog.mdx#template) so that remote URLs appear as links within the changelog.
:::

Release assets whose [path](release-assets.mdx#path) cannot be resolved to a local file are skipped.

:::warning
Due to a limitation in the underlying library, the command line version does not support uploading the asset description. Only file names are uploaded and displayed.
:::

#### Release flags support

This service type supports:

* [draft releases](release-types.mdx#publish-draft) (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository))
* [pre-releases](release-types.mdx#publish-pre-release) (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository))

#### GitHub configuration options

This service type supports the following [options](#options):

| Name                                           | Type    | Command Line Option                                        | Environment Variable                                       | Configuration File Option                        | Default                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `BASE_URI`                                     | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-BASE_URI=<URI>`                 | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_BASE_URI=<URI>`               | `services/<NAME>/options/BASE_URI`               | `https://api.github.com`                   |
| `AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`                         | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN=<TOKEN>`   | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN=<TOKEN>` | `services/<NAME>/options/AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`   | N/A                                        |
| `REPOSITORY_NAME`                              | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-REPOSITORY_NAME=<TOKEN>`        | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_REPOSITORY_NAME=<TOKEN>`      | `services/<NAME>/options/REPOSITORY_NAME`        | N/A                                        |
| `REPOSITORY_OWNER`                             | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-REPOSITORY_OWNER=<TOKEN>`       | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_REPOSITORY_OWNER=<TOKEN>`     | `services/<NAME>/options/REPOSITORY_OWNER`       | N/A                                        |

`BASE_URI` is meant to be used if you're using GitHub on a self hosted environment. If that's your case just pass the URI to your REST API endpoint here otherwise, if you're using the public service, do not pass any value.

`AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` is a [OAuth or Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) that is used to authenticate and perform access controlled operations. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work. Generally speaking here you can use a [template](templates.mdx#environmentvariable) that reads the [conventionally used](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_help_environment) `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` environment variable so you don't have to configure anything else, otherwise just paste a PAT here.

As of now Personal Access Tokens are the only supported authentication method. The token you use for this purpose needs to have all the `repo` [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

When running [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) pipelines consider fetching the token that is [automatically generated](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication) by GitHub and use it to set an environment variable as in [this example](../introduction/ci-cd.mdx#credentials).

:::info
You are encouraged to create a new token for this purpose.
:::

`REPOSITORY_NAME` is the name of the hosted repository. If your GitHub repository is `https://github.com/octocat/hello-world`, the value for this option is `hello-world`. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work.

`REPOSITORY_OWNER` is the name of the owner of hosted repository. If your GitHub repository is `https://github.com/octocat/hello-world`, the value for this option is `octocat`. If your repository is owned by an organization this is the organization name. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work.

### GitLab

The service of `GITLAB` [type](#type) giving you access to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) extra features. This service type supports the `RELEASES` and `RELEASE_ASSETS` [features](#service-features) to publish a [GitLab Release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) when a new release is produced, also with attached assets.

#### Release support

This service type supports all release publication features with no limitations. See below for release assets.

#### Release assets support

This service supports both local files and remote URLs for [release assets](release-assets.mdx).

Release assets whose [path](release-assets.mdx#path) represents a local file but cannot be resolved to an existing file are skipped.

#### Release flags support

This service type does not support:

* [draft releases](release-types.mdx#publish-draft)
* [pre-releases](release-types.mdx#publish-pre-release)

#### GitLab configuration options

This service type supports the following [options](#options):

| Name                                           | Type    | Command Line Option                                        | Environment Variable                                       | Configuration File Option                        | Default                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `BASE_URI`                                     | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-BASE_URI=<URI>`                 | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_BASE_URI=<URI>`               | `services/<NAME>/options/BASE_URI`               | `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`                |
| `AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`                         | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN=<TOKEN>`   | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN=<TOKEN>` | `services/<NAME>/options/AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`   | N/A                                        |
| `REPOSITORY_NAME`                              | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-REPOSITORY_NAME=<TOKEN>`        | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_REPOSITORY_NAME=<TOKEN>`      | `services/<NAME>/options/REPOSITORY_NAME`        | N/A                                        |
| `REPOSITORY_OWNER`                             | string  | `--services-<NAME>-options-REPOSITORY_OWNER=<TOKEN>`       | `NYX_SERVICES_<NAME>_OPTIONS_REPOSITORY_OWNER=<TOKEN>`     | `services/<NAME>/options/REPOSITORY_OWNER`       | N/A                                        |

`BASE_URI` is meant to be used if you're using GitLab on a self hosted environment. If that's your case just pass the URI to your REST API endpoint here otherwise, if you're using the public service, do not pass any value.

`AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` is a [OAuth2, Personal or Project Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) that is used to authenticate and perform access controlled operations. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work. A suggested value is a [template](templates.mdx#environmentvariable) that reads the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable so if you already have a token stored in `GITLAB_TOKEN` you don't have to configure anything else, otherwise just paste a PAT here. `GL_TOKEN` is another variable name often used for the same purpose.

As of now Personal Access Tokens are the only supported authentication method. The token you use for this purpose needs to have the `api`, `read_api` and `write_repository` [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-token-scopes).

:::info
You are encouraged to create a new token for this purpose.
:::

`REPOSITORY_NAME` is the name of the hosted repository. If your GitLab repository is `https://gitlab.com/jdoe/project`, the value for this option is `project`. If you're using an [hierarchical organization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/) remember to avoid passing the leading and trailing slashes here. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work.

`REPOSITORY_OWNER` is the name of the owner of hosted repository. If your GitLab repository is `https://gitlab.com/jdoe/project`, the value for this option is `jdoe`. If your repository is owned by an organization this is the organization name. If you're using an [hierarchical organization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/) remember to avoid passing the leading and trailing slashes here. This option is **mandatory** for the service in order to work.

## Service features

The list of possible service features is:

* `RELEASES`: services supporting this feature can be used to publish releases to hosting services
* `RELEASE_ASSETS`: services supporting this feature can also attach [assets](release-assets.mdx) to published releases

:::info
Please note that using a service for a feature that is not supported will result in an error.
