# GitHub Action

:::tip
Check out [this section](../introduction/usage.mdx#using-the-github-action) for a full reference on the GitHub Action.
:::

In the simplest case you just need the Action to [compute](../introduction/how-nyx-works.mdx#infer) the version number from the repository commit history. [This example](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/blob/main/.github/workflows/example-get-version-using-action.yml) shows how:

```yaml
jobs:
  infer-version:
    name: Infer the repository version with Nyx
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Git checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    // highlight-start
    - name: Nyx infer
      id: nyx
      uses: mooltiverse/nyx@main
    // highlight-end
    - name: Print version # This step uses the version inferred by Nyx
      run: echo the inferred version is ${{ steps.nyx.outputs.version }}
```

Very simple, and you can then use the version as `${{ steps.nyx.outputs.version }}`.

If you want Nyx not just to *read* the repository but also [publish](../introduction/how-nyx-works.mdx#publish) a release or [push](../introduction/how-nyx-works.mdx#mark) changes to a remote repository, you also need to pass the [credentials](../configuration-reference/services.mdx#github-configuration-options) using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and giving the `mark` or `publish` [command](../introduction/how-nyx-works.mdx), like in [this example](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/blob/main/.github/workflows/example-publish-uning-action.yml):

```yaml
jobs:
  infer-version:
    name: Publish the release (if any) with Nyx
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Git checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    // highlight-start
    - name: Nyx publish
      id: nyx
      uses: mooltiverse/nyx@main
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        NYX_VERBOSITY: 'INFO'
      with:
        command: 'publish'
        changelogPath: 'CHANGELOG.md'
        preset: 'extended'
        releaseLenient: 'true'
        stateFile: '.nyx-state.json'
        summaryFile: '.nyx-summary.txt'
    // highlight-end
```

Here the [*verbosity*](../configuration-reference/global-options.mdx#verbosity) is passed as an environment variable (`NYX_VERBOSITY`) just like the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, while we also use the [*extended*](../configuration-presets/extended.mdx) [preset](../configuration-presets/index.md) and generate a few other files from Nyx. The `GH_TOKEN` is an arbitrary name and needs to match the one used for the configured [`AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN`](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/docs/user/configuration-reference/services/#github-configuration-options).

In order to avoid hardcoding values, secrets can be fetched from environment variables, like in this configuration snippet from a `.nyx.json` [configuration file](../configuration-reference/global-options.mdx#configuration-file) (to be stored in your Git repository):

```json
"services":{
    "github": {
      "type": "GITHUB",
      "options": {
        "AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN": "{{#environmentVariable}}GH_TOKEN{{/environmentVariable}}",
        "REPOSITORY_NAME": "myrepo",
        "REPOSITORY_OWNER": "acme"
      }
    }
  },
```
