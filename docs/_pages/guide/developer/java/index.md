In this section you can find instructions to use the available Java libraries to be used in your own projects.

All java libraries have public API docs hosted [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx/java) (thanks [javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/)).

All artifacts are available at the [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx) and the [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/packages/) repositories.

The available libraries are:

* **[Nyx Main]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/developer/java/nyx-main.md %})**: the entire Nyx implementation available as a library for you to embed and use
* **[Semantic Version]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/developer/java/semantic-version.md %})**: a flexible implementation of the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification with full support for parsing, ordering, bumping and manipulating versions and their identifiers
