## Alternatives

### How does *Nyx* compare to [*semantic-release*](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)? Isn't *semantic-release* enough?

*semantic-release* is an excellent tool and if you're working on Node projects you should definitely go that way. However, when not on Node projects, it introduces some constraints that are not always so simple to overcome. *Nyx* is an alternative to *semantic-release* for those cases.

## Miscellaneous

### Where does the Nyx name come from?

Nyx is named after *3908 Nyx*, a notable [Mars crossing asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3908_Nyx), which in turn is named after the [the Greek goddess of the night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx). We liked the name as it's three letters like the number of a semantic version number.
