# Nyx Release Notes

## 2.3.0

This release is available at [this link](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/releases/tag/2.3.0).

### Upgrade instructions

* existing State files must be generated again due to the change of the format of timestamp offsets for Git commits

### New features and improvements

This release:

* adds support for remote [changelog templates](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/changelog/#template) ([#158](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/158))
* adds support for Gradle 8.0 ([#162](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/162)), while backward compatibility doesn't change

### Fixed issues

This release:

* fixes a bug that prevented State files serialized with one version of the tool (Go or Java) to be deserialized with another version, due to the format used to serialize the Git author action or commit action timestamp offets ([#170](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/170)). Now offsets are stored as simple signed integers. With more details, Git author actions and commot actions had their timestamps with a string representing the offset to UTC. That format was not portable so now they are stored as positive or negative integers, representing the offset in minutes from UTC. The field name within the `timeStamp` structure has changed from `timeZone` to `offset`.

## 2.2.0

This release is available at [this link](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/releases/tag/2.2.0).

### Upgrade instructions

There are no actions to take for backward compatibility.

### New features and improvements

This release:

* this release adds support for the `summary` and `summaryFile` configuration options, for an easily parseable output from Nyx ([#156](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/156))

### Fixed issues

There are no fixes in this release.

## 2.1.0

This release is available at [this link](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/releases/tag/2.1.0).

### Upgrade instructions

There are no actions to take for backward compatibility.

### New features and improvements

This release:

* this release extends backward compatibility for the Java version (the command line version is not affected) ([#153](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/153)), in details:
  * the recommended JVM version is `15` or newer and the recommended Gradle version is `7.0` or newer
  * older Java versions starting from `11` and older Gradle versions starting from `6.0` are supported with the exception of Gradle versions between `6.5` and `6.9.3` (see [#153](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/153#issuecomment-1416732299))
  * JVM versions older than `11` and Gradle versions older than `6.0` are not supported

### Fixed issues

There are no fixes in this release.

## 2.0.0

* when using the Java (Gradle) version, the minimum Java version is now `15` and the minimum Gradle version is `7.0` (see [here](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/introduction/usage/#requisites-1) and [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)); Gradle versions from `6.7` on should still work but they are no longer tested
* the public key (SSH) authentication method is now supported for Git ([#94](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/94))
* the Git internal library (`github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/modules/go/nyx/git` package for Go, `com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx.git` package for Java) has been refactored in order to support multiple authentication mechanisms (with the new SSH method) and some methods have been replaced while others have been added
* support for deprecated [template functions](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/templates/#functions) `environment.user`, `environment.variable`, `file.content`, `file.exists` has been removed, replaced by `environmentUser`, `environmentVariable`, `fileContent`, `fileExists`
* new parametric [template functions](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/templates/) are now available: `capture`, `cutLeft`, `cutRight`, `replace`, `timeFormat` ([#104](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/104), ([#119](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/119)))
* Java template functions in `com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx.template.Functions.java` no longer implement the `java.util.function.Function` interface which was provided for backward compatibility; from now on they only implement the `com.github.jknack.handlebars.Helper` interface provided by [Handlebars](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java)
* release assets published to GitLab now show their Description instead of the File Name ([#128](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/128))
* the [state](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/state-reference/global-attributes/) now has two additional boolean attributes: `coreVersion` and `latestVersion`, telling if the current version is a *core* version (using only core identifiers) and if it is the latest version (compared to all tags in the repository) ([#105](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/issues/105))

This release is available at [this link](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/releases/tag/2.0.0).

### Upgrade instructions

* if you are using the Java (Gradle) version make sure you run Java `15` and Gradle `7.0` or newer
* if you embedded Nyx in your code and used the `github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/modules/go/nyx/git` Go package or the `com.mooltiverse.oss.nyx.git` package, fix your code reflecting the changes made to the API
* if you plan to use Git SSH authentication please refer to [the configuration reference](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/git/) for the required configuration options
* replace usage of deprecated [template functions](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/templates/#functions) `environment.user`, `environment.variable`, `file.content`, `file.exists` (with dots) with `environmentUser`, `environmentVariable`, `fileContent`, `fileExists` (camel case names) in the configuration

### New features and improvements
