This release is available at [this link](https://github.com/mooltiverse/nyx/releases/tag/1.2.1).

### Upgrade instructions

If you use Gradle and [configure Nyx through the Gradle Extension](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/introduction/usage/#using-the-extension) with some [release assets](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/release-assets/) and also filter release assets within release types using the [assets filter](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/release-types/#assets) you need to update the assets filter configuration to use a simple string (defining a comma separated list of asset names to enable for the release type) instead of a native list. For example you need to replace `assets = [ "asset1", "asset2" ]` with `assets = [ "asset1,asset2" ]` within each [release type](https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/guide/user/configuration-reference/release-types/).
